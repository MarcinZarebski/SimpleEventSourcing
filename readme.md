**Event sourcing** is based on idea of persisting the state of a business entity as a sequence of state-changing events. Whenever the state of a business entity changes, a new event is appended to the list of events. Project **SimpleEventSourcing** contains building blocks used to implement event sourcing. It uses invoices as domain objects and presents how commands, events and handlers can be defined to perform some basic tasks on domain objects. My main goal was to learn about event sourcing and I decided not to implement database repositories, I did not use service layer and I did not add configuration. In this project I focused on understanding concepts of commands, events and handlers.

In next step I implemented Saga/Process manager to handle situation when two aggregates are created. This has some advantages over creating them in event handler using two transactions. If server crashes after invoice is created and before invoice items are added, then it will not be able to continue the process. Role of process manager is routing messages between aggregates and managing a long-running business process that spans multiple bounded contexts.
